A Python-based web application for recommending movies using a simple machine learning model and interactive exploratory data analysis (EDA). This project uses a Logistic Regression classifier trained on IMDB movie ratings and vote counts to predict whether a user might like a movie or not.

1. Browse and search movies by title, genre, director, actor
2. View detailed information and EDA charts for each movie
3. Predict whether youâ€™ll like a movie based on its rating and popularity
4. Interactive EDA visualizations for genre popularity, rating distribution, and more
5. Flask-based lightweight web app with clean, responsive HTML templates
6. Logistic Regression-based ML model trained on IMDB ratings data
